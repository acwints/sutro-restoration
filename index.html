            <p class="hero-subtitle">The Sutro Baths were once the world's largest indoor swimming establishment — a marvel of Victorian engineering that drew thousands daily. Today, only ruins remain. We're exploring whether thoughtful private investment could bring them back.</p>

            <h2>A palace by the sea</h2>
            <p>Adolph Sutro built the Sutro Baths as a gift to San Francisco — seven swimming pools, a museum, restaurants, and an amphitheater, all housed under 100,000 square feet of glass overlooking the Pacific. At its peak, 10,000 visitors came each day. It was democratic luxury: admission cost just a nickel.</p>

            <h2>Fire and abandonment</h2>
            <p>After decades of declining attendance and failed conversion attempts, the Baths burned in a suspicious fire during demolition. The National Park Service acquired the land in 1980, preserving what remained as a "stabilized ruin" — beautiful and haunting, but frozen in time. Nearly sixty years later, the site remains untouched.</p>

            <h2>A question worth asking</h2>
            <p>Could a public-private partnership restore the Sutro Baths while preserving public access? The National Park Service's Section 111 Historic Lease program allows private investment in historic properties on federal land. We're researching whether this model could work here — creating a self-sustaining landmark that serves San Francisco for generations to come.</p>

        <h2>This is an early exploration.</h2>
        <p>We're a small group of San Franciscans researching feasibility, understanding regulatory pathways, and building support. No formal proposal exists yet — we're still learning. If you share an interest in this vision, or have expertise to contribute, we'd welcome a conversation.</p>
