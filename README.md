**Live Site**: [sutro.vercel.app](https://sutro.vercel.app)

## About the Project

The Sutro Baths were once the world's largest indoor swimming establishment, built in 1896 by Adolph Sutro. After a devastating fire in 1966, only ruins remain. This project proposes a Section 111 Historic Lease to restore the site through private investment while maintaining public access.

### Key Features

- **Zone A (Private Sanctuary)**: Luxury thermal spa generating revenue for maintenance
- **Zone B (Public Access)**: Free tidal pools, observation decks, and interpretive center
- **$0 Taxpayer Cost**: 100% privately funded restoration

## Tech Stack

This is a static website built with:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (vanilla, no frameworks)
- Vanilla JavaScript (minimal, for interactions)
- Google Fonts (Playfair Display, Inter)

No build process required — just open `index.html` in a browser.
